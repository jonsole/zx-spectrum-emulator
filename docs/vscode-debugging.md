# Connecting VS Code (DAP)

Part of the [zx-spectrum-emulator README](../README.md).

The repo's `.vscode/` folder is a ready-to-use workspace: `tasks.json` builds
`cpp-core` and starts `zx_server.exe`, and `launch.json`'s **"ZX Spectrum:
Step through ROM"** configuration points at it. Two one-time setup steps are
required first, on top of [Setup](../README.md#setup):

1. **A real 48K ROM** — see [ROM](../README.md#rom) in the README.
   `launch.json` expects it at `roms/48.rom`.
2. **Install the `vscode-extension/` extension.** VS Code requires
   `launch.json`'s `type` to match a registered `contributes.debuggers`
   entry before it will even attempt a `debugServer` connection — this is
   true even though no actual adapter code is needed for that part, since
   `debugServer` overrides which process VS Code talks to (see the [extension
   guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/debugger-extension)).
   The repo's `vscode-extension/` directory is a small real extension (it
   also provides the live screen viewer — see below) — copy or symlink it
   into your VS Code extensions folder:

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell, from the repo root
   Copy-Item -Recurse .\vscode-extension "$env:USERPROFILE\.vscode\extensions\jonsole.zxspectrum-debug-0.0.2"
   ```

   Then reload VS Code ("Developer: Reload Window") to pick it up. See
   `vscode-extension/README.md` for details and re-install instructions after
   editing it.

With both in place, open the Run and Debug view and launch **"ZX Spectrum:
Step through ROM"**. The `preLaunchTask` starts the server automatically
(watch its output in the dedicated terminal panel) and waits for it to be
ready before connecting.

Without the ROM disassembly built (see below), this drives VS Code's
**Disassembly View** rather than a source view: breakpoints are instruction
breakpoints set from there, and each stack frame is labeled with just the
disassembled instruction at its address (no symbol name). Stepping is `next`
(one Z80 instruction) regardless. Supported requests: `initialize`, `launch`/`attach`,
`configurationDone`, `setInstructionBreakpoints`, `setBreakpoints`,
`continue`/`next`/`stepIn`/`stepOut`/`pause`, `threads`, `stackTrace`,
`disassemble`, `scopes`/`variables` (a **Registers** scope — including the
shadow set `AF'`/`BC'`/`DE'`/`HL'` — and a **Flags** scope breaking `F` out
into `S`/`Z`/`H`/`P·V`/`N`/`C` booleans), `readMemory`/`writeMemory`, and
`disconnect`.

**Verified working in an actual live VS Code session**, not just
protocol-level: launch, breakpoints, continue-to-breakpoint, disassembly-view
navigation (forward and backward from an arbitrary PC, including across the
0xFFFF/0x0000 address wrap), and register inspection all confirmed by hand
against the real ROM. A couple of real bugs turned up exactly this way and
are already fixed — see [Status & roadmap](status.md) and the git
history for details.

One current UI rough edge, not fixable from the adapter side: for a
source**less** frame (i.e. without the ROM disassembly built), VS Code
doesn't reliably auto-populate the Registers panel or auto-focus the
Disassembly View on every stop — clicking the Call Stack entry once after a
stop refreshes it. Tracked upstream as
[microsoft/vscode#131253](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/131253).

## Live screen viewer

Run **"ZX Spectrum: Show Screen"** from the Command Palette (or just launch a
debug session — it opens automatically) for a live view of the display
alongside your code, fed by a third server port (`--screen-port`, default
`8500`) that streams the screen as a continuous sequence of PNG frames (10fps)
to any connected client. The extension bridges that stream into a webview
panel; watch it update in real time as you step, run, or drive the machine
over MCP.

This port is a plain, independent front-end onto the shared `Engine` — the
same standalone-server design as DAP and MCP, not something that only works
through VS Code. Any client can connect directly and read the same frames
(4-byte big-endian length prefix + that many PNG bytes, repeated for as long
as the connection stays open) — see `cpp-core/src/screen_stream.cpp`.

Frames are read via `engine.machine.render_screen()` directly rather than
through the engine's normal command queue — a `run()` in progress occupies
the actor loop for its entire duration, so a queued read would sit unserved
(and the view would visibly freeze) until it stopped. Same queue-bypass
pattern DAP's own memory reads already use, for the same reason.

## Call stack

`stackTrace` shows a real, multiple-frame call stack, not just the current
PC: `Spectrum48K` tracks `CALL`/`RST` and their matching `RET` as they
execute (`spectrum.cpp`'s call-stack tracking), so stepping into a routine adds a
frame for it, each labeled and sourced exactly like the top frame (using
whichever debug info covers that address — the loaded program's own, or the
ROM's). It's a live opcode-level watch, not stack-memory guesswork — the Z80
has no frame-pointer convention, so there's no reliable way to tell a return
address from ordinary pushed data by inspection alone.

Two things it deliberately doesn't track, both rare in practice: interrupt
handler entry/exit (`RETI`/`RETN`) is invisible to it on purpose, so it
can't desync the frames it *does* track; and code that unwinds the stack by
resetting SP directly instead of matching `RET`s one-for-one (an idiom the
ROM itself uses for error handling) can leave stale frames until the next
real `CALL`/`RET` resyncs things. Cleared automatically on reset, a new
snapshot, or any direct PC/register write, since a stale call chain would
be actively misleading rather than just incomplete.

## Source-level debugging of the ROM

The 48K ROM's disassembly has been reverse-engineered and fully commented by
others — [SkoolKit's `skoolkid/rom`](https://github.com/skoolkid/rom)
reproduces *The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly* (Logan & O'Hara) as a
`.skool` file. `scripts/build_rom_source.py` turns that into a real source
view for the DAP session:

```
skoolkid/rom (.skool)  →  skool2asm.py  →  sjasmplus --sld  →  rom_disassembly/
                                                                  rom.asm  (readable, labeled source)
                                                                  rom.sld  (address <-> source-line map)
```

Run it once. The `scripts/` helpers are Python — the only part of the project
that still is — and want their own venv: `python -m venv .venv-win` then
`.\.venv-win\Scripts\pip.exe install skoolkit`, plus `sjasmplus` on PATH (see
the script's `--help` for where to get a build per platform):

```sh
.venv-win\Scripts\python.exe scripts\build_rom_source.py
```

It clones `skoolkid/rom` into `.rom-disassembly-src/` and writes
`rom_disassembly/rom.asm` + `rom.sld` — both gitignored, since the
disassembly (like the ROM binary itself) is copyrighted material fetched
locally, never committed. The script **refuses to write output** unless the
freshly assembled binary is byte-for-byte identical to `roms/48.rom` — a
mismatch would mean the address↔source-line map can't be trusted for
debugging, which is worse than not having one.

Once built, the DAP server picks it up automatically (no config needed) the
next time it starts: stack frames get a real `source`/`line` into
`rom.asm` (VS Code opens it and highlights the current line on every stop,
labeled with its nearest routine — e.g. `KEY_INT+3`), and breakpoints can be
set by clicking the gutter in that file directly, resolved to addresses via
the SLD map. Instruction breakpoints (from the Disassembly View) still work
and can be mixed freely with source breakpoints in the same session.

## Source-level debugging of your own program

Assembled your own program with `sjasmplus --sld`? Attach its `.sld` plus
the source it was built from, and get everything above for your own code
too — real `source`/`line` in stack frames, gutter breakpoints, and
`resolve_symbol`/`resolve_address`. It's layered on top of the ROM's own
source (not a replacement for it): your program's debug info is checked
first, and a `CALL` into a ROM routine still resolves to `rom.asm` once
execution is inside it, so you don't lose one to get the other.

Over MCP:

```
load_snapshot(sna_base64=...)
load_debug_info(sld_path="C:/path/to/yourprogram.sld", asm_path="C:/path/to/yourprogram.asm")
```

Over DAP, add `sld`/`asm` to the launch config alongside `snapshot`:

```json
{
  "name": "My program",
  "type": "zxspectrum",
  "request": "launch",
  "debugServer": 4711,
  "rom": "${workspaceFolder}/roms/48.rom",
  "snapshot": "${workspaceFolder}/yourprogram.sna",
  "sld": "${workspaceFolder}/yourprogram.sld",
  "asm": "${workspaceFolder}/yourprogram.asm",
  "preLaunchTask": "zxspectrum-cpp.start-server"
}
```

Loading a *new* snapshot always clears the previously-attached debug info
(it almost certainly doesn't match the new program's addresses) — reattach
with `load_debug_info`/relaunch for whatever program you loaded next. The
ROM's own source is unaffected either way; it's always available
independently once built.
